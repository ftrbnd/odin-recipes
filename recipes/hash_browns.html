    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. 
            Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. 
            When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. 
            Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. 
            It should take at least 5 minutes per side. 
            If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
